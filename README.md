# declaro - a simple declarative wrapper for any package manager

## üöÄ Why This Project Exists

- **üöß The Problem:** Desktop Linux systems accumulate unnecessary packages over time ‚Äî apps installed briefly, forgotten, and left to clutter your system. This is a nightmare for small disks and system hygiene (run `pacman -Qq | wc -l` to see how many packages you have installed).

- **ü§î Why Current Solutions Fall Short:** Tools like NixOS are powerful but overly complex for users who don‚Äôt need complete reproducibility - just a clutter-free system.

- **üí° Our Solution:** A powerful declarative package manager wrapper that:
    - ‚úÖ Lets you define a clean "reset state" for your system
    - üîÑ Provides tools to manage and reset your system back to that declarative state
    - üìù Forces you to explicitly define what you want to keep, rather than what you want to remove

## Usage

### Define Your Clean System State

First, start by generating the packages list from the current list of explicitly installed packages:

```bash
declaro generate
```

This will create the `packages.list` file in `/etc/declaro/packages.list` (you can change this location in the config file). Then, you may edit this file either manually:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/declaro/packages.list
```

Or by running:

```bash
declaro edit
```

Here, you can add packages you want to keep permanently, or delete packages you no longer require. The `packages.list` file format is one package per line, with optional comments:

```bash
# Creative Software
gimp
audacity # This one is for audio
blender

# Programming
bash
gcc
neovim # My favorite text editor
```

### Main Commands

- **`declaro clean`**: Removes all stray packages (installed packages not declared in `packages.list`) and installs all missing packages (packages declared in `packages.list` but not installed)
- **`declaro diff`**: Shows the difference between your current system and your `packages.list`
- **`declaro list`**: Lists all packages in your `packages.list`
- **`declaro edit`**: Opens `packages.list` in your default editor (defined by `$EDITOR`)
- **`declaro declare <pkg1> <pkg2> ...`**: Declares packages by appending them to `packages.list`
- **`declaro status <pkg1> <pkg2> ...`**: Shows the status of packages

## Configuration

`declaro` was written to be package manager agnostic. As such, integrating with a package manager is as simple as defining three functions in a config file at `/etc/declaro/config.sh`. Consider our [`apt-config.sh`](config/apt-config) for Ubuntu systems:

```bash
# Command to install a package and its dependencies (no confirm/user prompts)
UNINSTALL_COMMAND () {
  sudo apt-get remove $@ -y
}
# Command to install a package and its dependencies (no confirm/user prompts)
INSTALL_COMMAND () {
  sudo apt-get install $@ -y
}
# Command to list all manually/explicitely installed packages
LIST_COMMAND () {
  apt-mark showmanual
}
```

Currently, we provide config files for `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `pacman-paru` and `pacman-yay` package managers. And we will keep adding more as we go. If you want to add support for your package manager, please open an issue or a pull request.

## Install

### Automatic Installation

- For **Arch Linux**, you can download `declaro` from the AUR:
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/declaro-git.git && cd declaro-git && makepkg -si
```

### Manual Installation

1. Make sure you have the following the dependencies installed:
```git bash diffutils sed findutils make sudo coreutils```

2. Clone the repository and install declaro:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mantinhas/declaro.git && cd declaro && make install
```

3. Pick the config file that matches your package manager:
    - For supported distros (Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL):
        1. Pick the matching config file from the ones we provide:
        ```bash
        ls /usr/local/share/declaro/config
        ```
        2. Install it to `/etc/declaro/config.sh`:
        ```bash
        sudo install -Dm644 /usr/local/share/declaro/config/<your-config-file>.sh /etc/declaro/config.sh
        ```
    - For unsupported distros:
        1. Copy the template config file:
        ```bash
        sudo install -Dm644 /usr/local/share/declaro/config/template-config.sh /etc/declaro/config.sh
        ```
        2. Edit the config file to match your package manager's commands. Refer to the [Configuration Section](#configuration) for more details. 
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/declaro/config.sh
        ```
